## Overview

Use the Exchange Graph API to query Exchange assets, filter by multiple criteria, and return only the information you need.

### API Prerequisites and Dependencies

Using the Exchange Graph API does not require an Anypoint Platform account. When the API is used without an account, it returns only assets made publicly available by MuleSoft.

Using the API to access private content requires an Anypoint Platform account.

### Accessing the API

Create an Anypoint Platform account. If your organization already has an Anypoint Platform account, request an invitation by email from your organization administrator.

There is no charge for using this API.
